## Insight



TTS Accelerator is a smart and powerful tool that turns text into speech super fast. You can give it a really long paragraph â€” even up to 16,000 characters â€” and it starts speaking in just **2 seconds**.

Most other TTS systems wait until the full audio is ready before they start, which can take ages. *But this one is different* â€” it starts playing while itâ€™s still generating. So, you can hear the voice as soon as the script runs â€” no matter how long the text is. The result? Natural, smooth speech with no delay.


## Key Features

- *Real-Time TTS*: Speak extremely long texts within 2â€“3 seconds startup.
- *Compatible with Any Library*: Works with local TTS engines (like Edge-TTS) and even API-based services (like ElevenLabs, Typecast.ai, etc.).
- *Streaming Playback*: **Audio starts playing while it is still being generated.**
- *Library-Independent Core*: Easily pluggable with your preferred TTS backend.
- *Minimal API*: Just one function call to start speaking â€” speak_text(text).
