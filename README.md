TTS Accelerator is a smart and powerful tool that turns text into speech super fast. You can give it a really long paragraph â€” even up to 16,000 characters â€” and it starts speaking in just **2 seconds**.

Most other TTS systems wait until the full audio is ready before they start, which can take ages. *But this one is different* â€” it starts playing while itâ€™s still generating. So, you can hear the voice as soon as the script runs â€” no matter how long the text is. The result? Natural, smooth speech with no delay.
